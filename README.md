TODO: organize 'main' to be the same as 'main_kaggle'

# CvT_Quantization
This directory is for the mini-project of the "Deep Learning" course at Technion.
To run this code you can just download, in the main section change the arguments in the parser.

If you don't have a GPU - you should go to 'main_kaggle' and run that on kaggle. 
remember to change all path values to what you want.

to run efficiently on kaggle we downsized the validation set of imagenet using the 'Dataset' module.
it is also ready to run, only the path arguments need to be changed.
